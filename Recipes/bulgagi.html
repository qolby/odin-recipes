    <p class="description">Bulgogi, literally "fire meat" is a gui made of thin, marinated slices of meat, most commonly beef, grilled on a
    barbecue or on a stove-top griddle. It is also often stir-fried in a pan in home cooking. Sirloin, rib eye or brisket
    are frequently used cuts of beef for the dish.</p>

      <h2>Direction</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix garlic, grated onion, grated ginger, toasted sesame oil, and brown sugar together in a mixing bowl. Stir in grated
        pear, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Transfer meat to marinade and toss to coat on all sides. Cover and refrigerate, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Season meat with salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil. Toss.</li>
        <li>Brush a cast iron skillet with a little vegetable oil and place over high heat. When the skillet is very hot, add beef
        in a single layer and cook until meat begins to caramelize around the edges and moisture begins to evaporate, 2 to 3
        minutes per side. Serve over hot rice and top with green onion slices.</li>
